# Student Enrollment Form
It is a student registration form that uses JSONPowerDB to store user information. Both serverless technology and REST APIs are supported. A student's roll number can be used to add or update them. The roll number is automatically verified on this form, and with the use of an API, the data submitted into other input fields is also verified so that the user can change as necessary. AJAX requests are used by the programme to enable quick and seamless interaction. Data of every kind, including numbers, strings, dates, and more, can be saved.
